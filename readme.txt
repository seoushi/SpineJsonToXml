SpinJsonToXml does what it's name says it converts spline skeletons and animations from json to xml.
Compile in eclipse and create a runable jar.
The tool will look in the existing folder and all subdirectorys recursively for any json files. Files with "skeleton" in thier name get parsed into a skeleton xml file and files with "animation" in thier name get parsed into an animation file.

Enjoy.
